## Slack Incoming Webhook

It uses `slackweb`, a python library.

## How to get UNIPA

It uses python libraries `selenium` and` chromedriver-binary`.

When using `chromedriver-binary`, you need the appropriate GoogleChrome for that version.
Currently, Chrome79 is supported. If you want to run on another version,

```sh
pipenv install chromedriver-binary=={version}
```

Please install a new library using.
